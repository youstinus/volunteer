# :pizza: Vue Pizza

> A tasty Vue.js starter project. Clone, remove `vue-pizza` everywhere, and add your own features. Also, read through the wiki.

## Demo

[https://vue.pizza/app](https://vue.pizza/app)

## Why?

A lot of starter projects or examples of Vue.js in the wild were: 

- Outdated.
- No tutorial or wiki.
- Involved unneccesary, complex, server-side-rendering/NUXT setups (this project is for authenticated, no SEO needed, static/cacheable apps that communicate to a backend server API).
- Not comprehensive and didn't cover most of the elements necessary for real world apps.
- This project was started from the latest official Vue-cli PWA template and built up from there.

## Wiki

Visit the Github wiki tab [here](https://github.com/prograhammer/vue-pizza/wiki) to learn everything you need to know about
how this starter project was built (which allows you to learn and rebuild this project from scratch if you want).

## Installation

Very simple. See the Installation section in [wiki](https://github.com/prograhammer/vue-pizza/wiki).
